    "### Vectorization in `numpy`\n",
    "As programmers, we're used to writing for-loops to iterate over collections. This is quite OK but in Python makes the code slow (because it's an interpreted, dynamically-typed language). For example, a \"standard\" way of summing an array would be\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = [2, 3, 8, -2.3, 0, 15]\n",
    "python_sum = 0\n",
    "for i in range(len(x)):\n",
    "    python_sum += x[i]\n",
    "print(python_sum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are better ways to do this. `numpy` works in C \"behind the scenes\". This means that:\n",
    "1. Operations in C are very, very, VERY fast\n",
    "2. Communication between C and Python is slow\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we should prepare our code to use `numpy` arrays as much as possible. First of all, this gives us a great computational advantage: the code is very fast. Second, it will look simpler and more beautiful. Compare the previous code with this one:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = [2, 3, 8, -2.3, 0, 15]\n",
    "numpy_sum = np.sum(x)\n",
    "print(numpy_sum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the for-loop is still done, it's just hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rule is **whenever possible, avoid looping and use vectors and matrices**. Sometimes it's impossible to avoid loops and that's OK.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a performance test. Create a large array of random numbers. You can use `np.random.random()`. Sum the array using `numpy` and using the for-loop. Compare the times. In some cases, the performance difference will be several hundred times (e.g. length = $1.10^7$, difference $\\approx 2000$ times: $\\approx 0.01ms$ for the `sum()` and $\\approx 2s$ for the loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to see that the sums are equal. A fast but incorrect algorihm is not an option :).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, call the function for different lengths and create two plots showing the time it takes to multiply different-length arrays. **Idea:** You can plot them on two separate y-axes on the same plot. Look at the `twiny()` function. See how much time it takes to perform both operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot another plot: speedup versus length. Plot the length on the x-axis and the speedup (`np_sum_time / for_loop time`) on the y-axis."
