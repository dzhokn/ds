# Linear Algebra

In this we cover the essence of linear algebra:
* Vector Spaces, Basis, Origin, Span
* Linear Independence, Linear Combination
* Matrix Operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Transpose, Inverse, Determinant)
* Vectorization in `numpy`
* Linear Transformations (Nullspace, Rank)
* Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues
* Centroid & Covariance Matrix

And some introduction to:
* Images represented as matrices
* Affine transformation, Homography
* Cover's theorem (kernel trick)
* Principal Component Analysis
