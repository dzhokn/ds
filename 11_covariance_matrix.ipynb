    "### Variance\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ s^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{(Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2}{N - 1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar{Y} $ is the mean of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance is roughly the **arithmetic average of the squared distance from the mean**. Squaring the distance from the mean has the effect of giving greater weight to values that are further from the mean. For example, a point 2 units from the mean adds 4 to the above sum while a point 10 units from the mean adds 100 to the sum.\n"
