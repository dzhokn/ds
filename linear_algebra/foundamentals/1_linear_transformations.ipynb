    "# Linear Transformation\n",
    "Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces over a field $\\mathbb{K}$. The function $f: V \\rightarrow W$ is a **linear transformation** if for all $\\vec{u}, \\vec{v} \\in V$ and all $ \\lambda , \\mu \\in \\mathbb{K} $, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(\\lambda u + \\mu v) = \\lambda f(u) + \\mu f(v) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-life it is also often called **linear map**. Transformations are being represented by transformation matrix $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nullspace of a Matrix\n",
    "The vector space of all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $Ax=0$ is called the **kernel** or **nullspace** of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Linear Function\n",
    "The difference between linear transformation and linear function is that the first maps vector space $V$ to vector space $W$, while the latter always maps vector space $V$ to a **scalar field** $F$. In other words the co-domain of a linear function is a field.\n",

    "# Dimension vs Rank\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension\n",
    "The dimension of a vector space is simply the cardinality (i.e. the number of vectors) of a basis (2, 3, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rank\n",
    "Rank is defined if you have a linear transformation (a matrix $A$). The rank of a $A$ is the max number of linearly independent columns of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the matrix \n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & 1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "has rank 2: the first two columns are linearly independent, so the rank is at least 2, but since the third is a linear combination of the first two (the first column plus the second), the three columns are linearly dependent so the rank must be less than 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 1 & 0 & 2\\\\\n",
    "-1 & -1 & 0 & -2\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "has rank 1: there are nonzero columns, so the rank is positive, but any pair of columns is linearly dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the transpose\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & -1 \\\\\n",
    "1 & -1 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "2 & -2 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "has rank 1 too. The statement that the *column rank* of a matrix equals its *row rank* is equivalent to the statement that the rank of a matrix is equal to the rank of its transpose, i.e., $rank(A) = rank(AT)$.\n"
